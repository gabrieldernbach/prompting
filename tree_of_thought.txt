Use this tree of thought template to asses and solve the given task.
In your first step, adjust the template to the task context.
In your second step, work through the update template step by step

Task

[Clear, concise description of the goal or problem.]

Context

[Relevant background, prior attempts, environment.]

Constraints

[Explicit limitations, performance metrics, ethics, tools.]

Reasoning Scratchpad

Step 1: Define the Crux

→ What is the structural constraint or bottleneck?
→ What is the highest-leverage intervention point?

Step 2: Identify Recursive Structure

→ Is this a repeating pattern or a one-shot issue?
→ Are there feedback loops, compounding effects, or path dependencies?

Step 3: Generate & Compress

→ List 3+ different solution schemas or strategies.
→ What is the simplest generative model that explains the problem?

Step 4: Leverage Evaluation

→ What are the trade-offs in speed, complexity, and scalability?
→ Which option offers maximum leverage per unit effort?

Step 5: Plan Components (MECE)

→ Decompose the chosen strategy into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive steps.
→ Prioritize by impact and dependency order.

Step 6: Execute First Pass

→ Build the minimal viable version, test the core logic.
→ Focus on high-signal scaffolding over polish.

Step 7: Evaluate & Iterate

→ Compare result to original intent.
→ What changed? What can be compressed, eliminated, or improved?
→ Update the problem model accordingly.
